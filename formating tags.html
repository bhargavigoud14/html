<p><mark>Two <i><b>strangers</b></i> met by chance on a rainy afternoon, sharing an umbrella as they waited for the bus.  
<strong>Days turned into weeks,</strong> and their casual conversations <del>blossomed into deeper feelings.</del> </mark> 
One night under the stars, they <em>exchanged</em> nervous confessions, hearts racing in the silence.  
<u>They built a life together,</u> full of laughter, travel, and endless late-night talks.  
<ins>Years later,</ins> they still walked hand in hand, the love that <strike>began in the rain only growing stronger.</strike> </p>
